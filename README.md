🚀 Just built a full-featured AI Chatbot Web App using Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion!

🧠 Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI

Animations: Framer Motion

PDF Parsing: PDF.js (via CDN)

Icons: Lucide React

UUID Handling: uuid

Security: DOMPurify for XSS protection

💡 Key Features:

📁 PDF Upload: Upload and parse PDF files directly in-browser using PDF.js (no backend needed)

💬 Dynamic Chat Interface: Supports multi-session conversations with a clean and responsive UI

⚡ AI Integration: Sends chat messages + uploaded PDF content to a Gemini-based AI API and returns intelligent responses

📜 Message History: Maintains message history across multiple chat sessions

🧼 Secure Rendering: Uses DOMPurify to safely render AI responses with basic formatting (bold, lists, code)

🎨 Modern UI/UX: Elegant cards for features, typing animations, and scrollable sidebar chat history

This was a great exercise in combining multiple modern web technologies to deliver a real-time, file-aware AI assistant with a smooth user experience.

Looking forward to adding more features like authentication, persistent chat storage, and voice input next! 🎯
